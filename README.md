# Aplicatie_Citeste_PDF
Read/Listen PDF files/books application with Python.
Only with a few lines of code we can create a great PDF reader app.
For this we need to:
1. Importing the libraries(pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion and PyPDF2 for PDF manipulation).
2. Initializing text-to-speech engine.
3. Transform this lines of code in a Audiobook app.(from an .py extension to .exe) with auto-py-to-exe.
