Read/listen PDF files/books application with Python.
Only with a few lines of code we can creat a great PDF reader
app.For this you need to:
1. Import the libraries: pyttsx3 and PyPDF2(for text-to-speech

2. Initializing text-to-speech engine.
3. You can transform this lines of code in a Audiobooks app (from an .py extension to a .exe.) with auto-py-to-exe
